# Algorithmic Philosophy: Computational Naturism

**The Essence**: Digital systems mimicking organic and universal behaviors through simplified physical laws.

## Core Tenets

1. **Emergent Complexity from Simple Rules**: Just as complex biological behaviors arise from simple chemical interactions, our art should emerge from basic computational rules (gravity, attraction, flow) applied to many agents. No pre-defined shapes; form must evolve.

2. **The Imperfection of the Digital**: Embrace the discrete nature of pixels and floating-point errors. Use noise not just as randomness, but as a texture of the digital medium. Let trails fade, particles drift, and colors blend in ways that screen rendering naturally supports.

3. **Parametric Exploration**: The beauty lies in the variation. Every piece must expose the variables of its universe—gravity strength, friction, noise scale. The user becomes the god of this mini-universe, tweaking the fundamental constants to see new worlds emerge.

4. **Visual Silence**: Avoid clutter. Use negative space to let the algorithms breathe. Trails should be ghostly, movements fluid. The aesthetic is clean, dark, and sophisticated, allowing the vibrant algorithmic output to take center stage.

## Application to Projects

- **Falling Circles**: Not just shapes dropping, but simulated mass responding to gravity and air resistance. The trail is the memory of their path.
- **Cosmic Orbits**: A simulation of the n-body problem simplified for visual harmony. Orbits shouldn't be perfect circles but chaotic, stable, or unstable paths depending on the "tuning".
- **Flow Fields**: Invisible rivers of math. Particles are just leaves floating on the surface of 3D Perlin noise.

This philosophy guides us to build systems, not pictures. We code the laws of physics for a universe that doesn't exist, and let the computer simulate its beauty.
